the meaning of different version: 

v2    using carton Phi(q) method.
v3    using direct numerical integration for Phi(q).
v4    adding miss iteration term for 1st order f1.
v4.1  (1)suspend the iteration logic, modify it based on my understanding.
      (2)adding search table method, such we can skip the table generate in several round test.
v5    stable version: (modification)
      (1)using direct numerical integration for Phi(q).
      (2)adding search table method, such we can skip the table generate in several round test.
      (3)reconstruct the logic for the iteration.
      (4)introduce a new global parameter to control the iteration for sterile neutrino.
      (5)modify the output ratio logic for sterile neutrino. Because the ratio for sterile neutrino
            may quite different from active neutrino.
v6    test & delete vesion:
      (1)adding missing bulk velocity term, but not accurate.
      (2)delete iteration, such that many intermediate data do not need to calculate, speed up the
            program for around 10 times.

~~~~ the above are deleted. 

v7    stable version:
      (1) table generation for Phi(q), s and hubbble parameter parallely.
      (2) reconstruct the neutrino free-streaming method by integrating with \rho_tot.
      (3) the Phi(q), s(\tau), h(\tau) is interpolated by table using gsl library.
      result: the simulation result is right even for power spectrum ratio.
      todo:
      (1) code reconstruction. to be much more unified and plugin-like.
      (2) parallel runing on free-streaming method.
      (3) free-streaming method should be coded as a module, such that the properties of sub-eV particles
            (not only active neutrino) can be set freely.
      (4) free-streaming method can be parallely running.
